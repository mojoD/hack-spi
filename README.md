# The Midiot and midiloops
## Project Goal  
+ Be able to seamlessly translate Midi files for use in Sonic Pi that will utilize samples derived from a Soundfont file.  
+ Create Sonic Pi functionality that will allow the ability to utilize Soundfont instruments in addition to the current sample and synth instruments.  
+ Be able to pull in midi files, midi tracks or portions/slices of midi tracks that will can be used in Sonic Pi live-loops to add another option to complement the sending individual notes, arrays of notes as currently done in Sonic Pi.  
+ Allow you pull in these midi "licks" with fragments of melodies much easier than manually entering them in Sonic Pi as you do today as notes to play and sleep commands.   

There is a Wiki that is attached to this project in GitHub that contains user manuals and technical documentation.  Also, a youtube playlist is available with tutorials showing how to use Midiot as a Midi Song Player or integrate it into your **"Live Coding"** performances.
